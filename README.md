# Project: ## Credit Risk Profiling: Unlocking Loan Default Patterns

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
	‚Ä¢ 	Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
	‚Ä¢ 	SQL: MySQL Workbench
	‚Ä¢ 	Power BI: Report development, DAX, KPI visuals
 	‚Ä¢ 	Excel

## üéØ Objective

To analyze patterns leading to loan defaults and prepare the dataset for machine learning modeling, with a focus on clean reporting and stakeholder insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

‚∏ª

## üìÅ Dataset Description
	‚Ä¢	Source: Open Loan Default Dataset (publicly available)
	‚Ä¢	Size: ~10,000 records
	‚Ä¢	Features: 20+ (including LoanAmount, CreditScore, EducationType, EmploymentType, LoanStatus, etc.)

## üîÑ Data Preprocessing Workflow

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Data Cleaning
	‚Ä¢	Removed nulls and duplicates from key columns like CreditScore, LoanAmount, and LoanStatus.
	‚Ä¢	Dropped the non-informative LoanID column.
	‚Ä¢	Standardized all column names to lowercase with snake_case for consistency.

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Data Type Fixing
	‚Ä¢	Converted object types to categorical (e.g., EmploymentType, EducationType).
	‚Ä¢	Transformed Yes/No columns into binary integers (0/1).

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL + Python)
	‚Ä¢	Ran 15+ custom SQL queries to explore borrower behavior by credit tier, loan amount, and status.
	‚Ä¢	Key findings:
	‚Ä¢	‚ÄòPoor‚Äô credit score borrowers defaulted at 3.2√ó higher rates.
	‚Ä¢	Unemployed applicants showed a 2.5√ó higher default risk.
	‚Ä¢	Secondary education holders had an 18% higher default rate compared to graduates.

### ‚úÖ Step 4: Encoding Categorical Features
	‚Ä¢	Applied:
	‚Ä¢	Label Encoding for binary and ordinal categories (e.g., LoanStatus, Gender)
	‚Ä¢	One-Hot Encoding for nominal multi-class fields (EmploymentType, EducationType, PropertyType)
	‚Ä¢	Ensured encoding was done before scaling and aligned with model requirements.

### ‚úÖ Step 5: Power BI Visualization
	‚Ä¢	Developed a 5-page interactive Power BI dashboard with filters, KPIs, and slicers.
	‚Ä¢	Created visuals to monitor:
	‚Ä¢	Default rates by Credit Score Group and Loan Term
	‚Ä¢	Revenue impact from defaults
	‚Ä¢	Distribution of borrowers by Education and Employment

### ‚úÖ Step 6: Min-Max Standardization
	‚Ä¢	Scaled key numerical features to 0‚Äì1 using MinMaxScaler:
	‚Ä¢	LoanAmount, CreditScore, AnnualIncome, Age
	‚Ä¢	Ensured compatibility with ML algorithms that are sensitive to scale (e.g., KNN, Logistic Regression).
